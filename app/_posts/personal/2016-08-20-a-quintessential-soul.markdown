There is a person I know who is as close to perfect as one can get. I will not be able to do justice with my words in writing about this amazing soul. Well, today is one of the
rare occasion when I can allow myself to give it a try.

Being happy every day is something that every one dreams of but only a few are able to attain. It so happens that this soul is one of those few vivacious creatures who are always found
wearing hidden smiles on their faces for no apparent reasons. It is always such a charm for a person like me, with dizzy and languid mornings, to be around with this soul and get
mesmerised by its luminous presence.

No matter how great the joy is and no matter how deep the sorrow gets, this fine individual can always contain its emotions within a range. An unexpected promotion or a missed opportunity, both
fail miserably to control the emotions of this impeccable being.

Extreme emotions are short lived. Perhaps this explains why poor souls like me, with emotions oscillating exponentially, could not remain happy for longer periods.

This person has an inexplicable network of neurons resulting in bad memory for bad events and good memory for good or perhaps interesting events. Disagreements with friends are
long forgotten but the taste of good food is remembered for years. Face of an *interesting but unimportant* character from a movie can be easily recalled while conveniently forgetting
*mundane but important* tasks like grocery shopping.  

It always puzzles me that how such a foodie can get so engrossed in work to easily forget the lunch-breaks. It makes me so envious because of my compelling need for taking
munching-breaks after every hour of work.

The presence of this spirit around work wonders for heightening one's aesthetic senses. In the company of this extraordinary individual, it is only a matter of some time
when one can learn to draw aesthetic pleasure from the contemplative engagement with a piece of art.   

It comes naturally to this person to separate the art from the artist. Well, not a complete separation, but the piece of art is used as a window into the artist's mind to appreciate its
virtuosity while ignoring the rest, often unreachable, parts(of the artist's mind).

That brings to another impressive quality of this amazing person: focusing more on ideas and less on people. It will take significant time to dig into my memory lane for memories, if any,
 where this person would have indulged in "discussing people".

No one would have seen this individual complaining for anything. It is highly imponderable that how this person keeps moving forward almost untroubled from any obstacle with no whining and grumbling.     

One of the most intelligent beings that I am fortunate to be around with. It is beyond my reckoning that how many times this person has brought my attention to little details that I could have easily overlooked. Things that take multiple iterations for me to comprehend generally opens up to this person in a single pass.

Yes, its quite astonishing to see so many qualities ingrained in a single individual. I am really glad to be around with such a quintessential soul.  

A very Happy Birthday to the most amazing person I have ever known!
