For the last one year I have been following [Makeover Monday][mamon] by [Andy Kriebel][andy] but never actually got down to make something.  Always kept thinking about it, but life kept getting in the way :) <!--more-->

When Andy also started [Workout Wednesday][wowed] in January 2017, it really caught my interest. The exercises looked interesting and challenging. Also I found a few people like [Charlie Hutcheson ][charlie] and [Rebecca Abrahams][rebecca] blogging about their experiences with this activity. 
Blogging is also one activity which has always been in my to-do list. What better way to combine and actually start doing something which was always on hold.

So, from now on I'll be attempting Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday every week and hopefully will write a post on them.

Cheers to good times!!
