I am a Research Analyst and find enjoyment in making sense of data and finding insights in plethora of information.

When I am not working I enjoy watching movies of varied genre and languages. I also love reading and my interest varies from Harry Potter to Martian, to Selfish Gene.

Lately I have become interested in data visualization and information design. Understanding how human mind perceives and interprets information really fascinates me.

I shall be using this space mainly for writing about my journey in data visualisation and occasionally about anything that intrigues me.
